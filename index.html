        <td id="tabletext">The piano-making firm of J & J Hopkinson was founded in Leeds in 1835 by the brothers John and James Hopkinson, and has always been regarded as among the best of the English manufacturers.
          The firm moved to London in 1846, and displayed examples of its pioneering products at the Great Exhibition of 1851.
          In 1866 a new factory was built for the brothers at 44 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, London. This elegant building, which still stands, is listed as being of particular architectural and historical interest.
          The firm continued to occupy these same presmises until 1947. Hopkinson was acquired by George Rogers & Sons Ltd in 1924. From that date until 2003, the Hopkinson piano is internally identical to the Rogers instrument,
          and has exactly the same musical and technical features, sharing the same quality of design and workmanship.<br>
          Today, J & J Hopkinson (registered trade mark UK00004101167) is a subsidiary of John Broadwood & Sons Ltd and operates from 2 John Street, Whitby, North Yorkshire, YO21 3ET.
          The firm can provide historical and technical information about Hopkinson instruments, whether uprights or grands, manufactured between the years 1914 and 2003.</td>
